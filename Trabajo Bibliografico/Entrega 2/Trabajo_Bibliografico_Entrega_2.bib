  abstract = {Nuclear alterations are a hallmark of many types of cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). Recent evidence shows that subvisual changes, ones that may not be visually perceptible to a pathologist, to the nucleus and its ultrastructural components can precede visual histopathological recognition of cancer. Alterations to nuclear features such as nuclear size and shape, texture, and spatial architecture reflect the complex molecular level changes that occur during oncogenesis. Quantitative nuclear morphometry, a field that uses computational approaches to identify and quantify malignancy-induced nuclear changes, can enable a detailed and objective analysis of the prostate cancer cell nucleus. Recent advances in machine learning-based approaches can now automatically mine data related to these changes to aid in diagnostic decision-making and prediction of PCa prognoses. In this review, we use prostate cancer as a case study to connect the molecular level mechanisms that underlie these nuclear changes to the machine learning computational approaches, bridging the gap between the clinical and computational understanding of PCa. First, we discuss recent developments to our understanding of molecular events that drive nuclear alterations in the context of prostate cancer: the role of the nuclear matrix and lamina in size and shape changes, the role of three-dimensional chromatin organization and epigenetic modifications in textural changes, and role the tumor microenvironment in altering nuclear spatial topology. We then discuss the advances in the applications of machine learning algorithms to automatically segment nuclei in prostate histopathological images, extract nuclear features to aid in diagnostic decision-making, and predict potential outcomes such as biochemical recurrence and survival. Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with translation of the quantitative nuclear morphometry methodology into the clinical space. Ultimately, accurate identification and quantification of nuclear alterations can contribute to the field of nucleomics and has applications for computationally driven precision oncologic patient care.},

  abstract = {Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

The nuclear distances were measured between the loci in chromosomal bands 7p22.3-7p21.3; 7q35-7q36.3; 11p15.5-11p15.4; 20p13; 20p12.2; 20q11.21 and 20q12 where increased expression had been found in all types of colorectal carcinoma. The loci were visualized by three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization using 22 BAC clones. Our results show that for short genomic separations, mean nuclear distance increases linearly with increased genomic separation. The results for some pairs of loci fell outside this linear slope, indicating the existence of different levels of chromatin folding. For the same genomic separations the nuclear distances were frequently shorter for tumor as compared with epithelial cells. Above the initial growing phase of the nuclear distances, a plateau phase was observed in both cell types where the increase in genomic separation was not accompanied by an increase in nuclear distance. The ratio of the mean nuclear distances between the corresponding loci in tumor and epithelium cells decreases with increasing amplification of loci. Our results further show that the large-scale chromatin folding might differ for specific regions of chromosomes and that it is basically preserved in tumor cells in spite of the amplification of many loci.},

  abstract = {Cancer cell migration is a complex process that requires coordinated structural changes and signals in multiple cellular compartments. The nucleus is the biggest and stiffest organelle of the cell and might alter its physical properties to allow cancer cell movement. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, which regulate numerous intracellular signals and biological functions under physiological conditions. Moreover, integrins orchestrate changes in tumor cells and their microenvironment that lead to cancer growth, survival and invasiveness. Most of the research efforts have focused on targeting integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling. Recent exciting data suggest the crucial role of integrins in controlling internal cellular structures and nuclear alterations during cancer cell migration. Here we review the emerging role of integrins in nuclear biology. We highlight increasing evidence that integrins are critical for changes in multiple nuclear components, the positioning of the nucleus and its mechanical properties during cancer cell migration. Finally, we discuss how integrins are integral proteins linking the plasma membrane and the nucleus, and how they control cell migration to enable cancer invasion and infiltration. The functional connections between these cell receptors and the nucleus will serve to define new attractive therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Cancer is diagnosed by examining the architectural alterations to cells and tissues. Changes in nuclear structure are among the most universal of these and include increases in nuclear size, deformities in nuclear shape, and changes in the internal organization of the nucleus. These may all reflect changes in the nuclear matrix, a non-chromatin nuclear scaffolding determining nuclear form, higher order chromatin folding, and the spatial organization of nucleic acid metabolism. Malignancy-induced changes in this structure may have profound effects on chromatin folding, on the fidelity of genome replication, and on gene expression. Elucidating the mechanisms and the biological consequences of nuclear changes will require the identification of the major structural molecules of the internal nuclear matrix and an understanding of their assembly into structural elements. If biochemical correlates to malignant alterations in nuclear structure can be identified then nuclear matrix proteins and, perhaps nuclear matrix-associated structural RNAs, may be an attractive set of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.

A decade later, investigators are beginning to look beyond the raw sequence to other mechanisms that affect gene expression. The main function of the nucleus is to maintain the genome and regulate gene expression. Changes in the expression of genes can drastically change the properties of the cell therefore giving the nucleus a role as the cell's "command post." In the past few years, one of the most notable discoveries in the study of the nucleus is that this organelle is not homogeneous. It is also not randomly organized; everything within the nucleus has a specific location with a specific function. Chromosome location within the nucleus relative to its center is directly related to transcription level. Additionally, there are specific regions of the nucleus where content and function differ. The various structures of the nucleus such as the membranes and matrix that supply support to the well protected chromatin offer ever increasing layers of complexity to the nucleus. Here, we focus on the nuclear matrix and its possible effects on signaling and cellular transformation leading to cancer.},

Deep learning approaches have been shown to produce encouraging results on histopathology images in various studies. In this paper, we propose a Spatially Constrained Convolutional Neural Network (SC-CNN) to perform nucleus detection. SC-CNN regresses the likelihood of a pixel being the center of a nucleus, where high probability values are spatially constrained to locate in the vicinity of the centers of nuclei. For classification of nuclei, we propose a novel Neighboring Ensemble Predictor (NEP) coupled with CNN to more accurately predict the class label of detected cell nuclei. The proposed approaches for detection and classification do not require segmentation of nuclei. We have evaluated them on a large dataset of colorectal adenocarcinoma images, consisting of more than 20,000 annotated nuclei belonging to four different classes. Our results show that the joint detection and classification of the proposed SC-CNN and NEP produces the highest average F1 score as compared to other recently published approaches. Prospectively, the proposed methods could offer benefit to pathology practice in terms of quantitative analysis of tissue constituents in whole-slide images, and potentially lead to a better understanding of cancer.},

In neither tumor did either the small or large nuclei display any X chromatin bodies. The main processes giving rise to the different types of nuclei are endoreduplication, true endomitosis, and a kind of polytenization.

Using a retrospective cohort of early stage NSCLC patients (Cohort \#1, n\,=\,70), we constructed a supervised classification model involving the most predictive features associated with disease recurrence. This model was then validated on two independent sets of early stage NSCLC patients, Cohort \#2 (n\,=\,119) and Cohort \#3 (n\,=\,116). The model yielded an accuracy of 81\% for prediction of recurrence in the training Cohort \#1, 82\% and 75\% in the validation Cohorts \#2 and \#3 respectively.

  abstract = {The architecture of cell nuclei is often altered in cancer cells. Specific tumour types are associated with characteristic alterations, and these provide an important diagnostic feature.The nuclear matrix participates in the spatial organization of the genome and other nuclear components. The protein composition of the nuclear matrix is altered in tumour cells and these changes might be useful tumour markers.Characteristic changes of nuclear shape and of chromatin texture can be induced in normal cells in vitro by oncogene activation. In vitro models will help to unravel the mechanisms by which oncogenes induce these tumour-specific nuclear changes and how these changes affect gene regulation.Chromosome territories and gene loci display characteristic spatial arrangements in cell nuclei, and these have an important role in the generation of diagnostically significant translocations associated with human malignancies.Structural alterations in tumour cells also include changes in nucleoli and the appearance of the perinucleolar compartment. These might be useful diagnostic markers in combination with automated imaging and image analysis.The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein, an essential component of PML bodies, is mislocalized in leukaemic cells of patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, leading to the disruption of PML bodies. Treatment with anticancer drugs leads to the reassembly of PML bodies and a reversion of the malignant phenotype.High-throughput nuclear-structure-based assays to screen drugs for their ability to revert malignancy-associated nuclear changes might identify new therapeutics.},
